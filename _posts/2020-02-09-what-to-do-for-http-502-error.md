It seems you are getting HTTP 5XX status code. We get HTTP 502 error if localhost web application is not responding. Generally speaking HTTP status code 502 means `Bad Gateway` which simply meant that the application is in the localhost is not responding. When we do remote port forwarding like `0:localhost:8080` then sysb looks at `0:` and allocate a available remote port and map it to your laptop's `localhost:8080`.

If you are getting a HTTP 502 status then it means your web services at `localhost:8080` is not responding on port `8080` locally. You need to verify the health of `localhost:8080` we can do following to alleviate the issue.

1. On your localhost verify if local port 8080 is listing while running any of the below commands on your localhost
    1. `nc -v -z localhost 8080`
    1. `telnet localhost 8080`
    1. `curl localhost:8080`

1. Perhaps it is possible that your local app application is not listening on `localhost:8080` but `localhost:5000` ( Python Flask ) or `localhost:4000` ( Ruby Jekyll ). Please adjust accordingly to command `ssh -R 0:localhost:8080 demo@sysb.ai` and start tunnel again.
