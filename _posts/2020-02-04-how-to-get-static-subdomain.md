Apart from cool dynamic subdomain we also have functionality to have static subdomain. We send `SYSB_SUBDOMAIN` environemnt variable via ssh client to get the static subdomain of sysb.AI. We advice you to choose a uniq subdomain as it is valid only until tunneling session. We issue a subdomain if it is available.

1. We need to export the environment variable and we run the below command on terminal:
```
export SYSB_SUBDOMAIN=my-awesome-subdomain
```
if you are using Windows then you can run `set SYSB_SUBDOMAIN=ticketfriend` in the command prompt to set the variable

1. Then we need to have below entry in `~/.ssh/config`
```
Host sysb.ai
    SendEnv SYSB_SUBDOMAIN
```
1. Now all we need to do is to execute below command to get the custome subdomain
```
ssh -R 0:localhost:8080 demo@sysb.ai
```

Alternatively, if we prefer ssh's command line flag of `ssh` over config file then we can also get it done as below:
```
export SYSB_SUBDOMAIN=my-awesome-subdomain
ssh -o SendEnv=SYSB_SUBDOMAIN -R 0:localhost:8080 demo@sysb.ai
```

If you need to get custom header also then have a look at [How to add Host header?]({% post_url 2020-02-05-how-to-add-custom-header %})

<!-- If you want to ensure this static subdomain survive the reboot of your localhost then we can automate that using autossh. e.g.
```
autossh -M 0 -f -R 0:localhost:8080 demo@sysb.ai
```
# Using SetEnv
We may use below config in our `~/.ssh/config` and put value of SYSB_SUBDOMAIN and SYSB_HOST_HEADER accordingly
```
Host sysb.ai
    SetEnv SYSB_SUBDOMAIN=my-awesome-subdomain
```

Then all we need to do is to run the following:
```
ssh -R 0:127.0.0.1:8080 demo@sysb.ai 
```
It will give us requested static subdomain like `https://my-awesome-subdomain.us.sysb.ai`. Alternatively, we can also use the command line flags of ssh to get it done, like below
```
ssh -o 'SetEnv SYSB_SUBDOMAIN=my-awesome-subdomain' -R 0:localhost:8080 demo@sysb.ai
``` -->
